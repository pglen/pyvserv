<h1>PyvServer</h1>
<h2>Fully encrypted TCP/IP server.</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; PyvServ is an encrypting TCP/IP server written in Python. The<br />
encryption algorithm is AES. (Advanced Encryption Standard) The key exchange<br />
uses ECC. (Elliptic curve) The server can be fully administered from the<br />
protocol side.</p>
<h2>How to use, what it is for:</h2>
<pre><code>Public Voting System Blockchain server.
Charity administration, trust maintenance. (Zakat)
Internal currency / resource maintenance.
</code></pre>
<h4>Public Voting System Blockchain server.</h4>
<p>The system maintains an encrypted chain of vote events. Every entry has<br />
(among others) the Voter ID, an Electronic ID, and the vote action (register / cast /<br />
un-cast / withdraw), and of course, the vote.</p>
<p>The voter ID is a number allocated by authorities, the Electronic ID is a<br />
number allocated on initial login / registration / transaction by the system.<br />
The Voter Block Chain, the associated IDs, and the vote is visible to the public,<br />
so every voter can verify his / her participation. The voter ID is visible, but<br />
the data behind it is known by the electorate only.</p>
<p>The blockchain may be replicated to independent hosts, so falsifying it<br />
would require breaching multiple services.</p>
<p>The blockchain visibility allows that every voter can verify their participation.<br />
This also allows all parties to verify the chain, and create independent counts.</p>
<p>The chain can  be verified for legitimate and singular registration. This system<br />
crates accountability from both the voter's side and the electorate (authority's) side.</p>
<h4>Charity administration, trust maintenance. (Zakat)</h4>
<p>The blockchain will allow the donation's public visibility and the donation's<br />
usage. It can accommodate arbitrary information, for instance: disbursement<br />
target, fund source, funding entity ... etc. The system handles unique IDs<br />
transparently, which allows privileged information to be encoded as a unique ID.<br />
This unique ID than can be turned back to real information by the publisher<br />
of the Unique ID, preserving privacy.</p>
<h4>Internal resource / currency maintenance</h4>
<p>The blockchain will allow monitoring internal resource allocation / usage.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; PyvServ contains protocol level encryption, which can be switched on by<br />
instructing the server to use an encryption (session) key.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; PyvServ contains a key exchange protocol, so the new session keys<br />
can be transmitted securely. The key exchange is based on ECC.</p>
<p>PyvServ has utilities to generate encryption keys. At least one<br />
key needs to be generated before use. (now automatic) The server picks from<br />
a pool of keys, so communication data is always distinctive. Make sure you<br />
generate some new keys with the 'pyvgenkeys' utility before production<br />
deployment.</p>
<p>PyvServ has blockchain empowered back end. The new data is linked to the<br />
previous record. Utilities to verify the data are also provided.<br />
(dbaseadm and chainadm)</p>
<p>PyvServ has file upload / download capabilities with encrypted transport.</p>
<p>PyvServ has replication facilities via a client based 'I have You have'<br />
 mechanism featuring encrypted transport. It is also capable of replication<br />
 on a 'replicate when received' mechanism. The replicated records are marked<br />
 with a replication count, so replication does not enter looping. By default,<br />
 the replicated records are not replicated any further, assuming a flat<br />
 structure of replication.</p>
<h4>Installation:</h4>
<pre><code>pip install pyvserv
</code></pre>
<p>Newer Linux-es do not allow pip to modify the system, pyvserv may be installed<br />
 with pipx, which separates the sever process into a virtual environment.</p>
<p>Dependencies:</p>
<p>Most linux systems already have all the dependencies by default. Some dependencies<br />
 are added automatically on installation.</p>
<pre><code> pydbase, pyvpacker, pyvecc, pyvguicom
</code></pre>
<p>The firewall needs to be opened for incoming connections on port NN</p>
<p>For example (assuming port 6666):</p>
<pre><code>sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6666
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --sport 6666
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that this is not a recommendation, it is a port we used during<br />
 development.</p>
<h4>Start server</h4>
<p>The python server can be added to the system servers with the Makefile targets<br />
'make genservice' and 'make instservice'<br />
 The scripts will generate the service file to run under current user's<br />
 credentials, and install it onto the running system. (requires sudo)</p>
<h4>Platforms:</h4>
<p>This project was developed on Ubuntu 22.x. Most linux distributions should work.<br />
It is ported to Windows MSYS2, with all major functions operating as expected.</p>
<p>On Fedora, the service files need to be re-written to accomodate the<br />
quirk that the Fedora systectl does not allow user executables.</p>
<p>One solution is to install the 'pip pyvserv' as root, and adjust the service<br />
file accordingly. If you want to use pyvserv with particular data directory,<br />
use the -r option.</p>
<p>On Debian and newer Ubuntu-s (23+) the system needs the --break-system-packages<br />
option on pip. If that is not desired, one may create a venv for pyvserv.<br />
This is a cautionary arrangement for the OS, pyvserv does not break anything.<br />
The other solution is to use pipx.</p>
<pre><code>pip install pyvserv --break-system-packages
</code></pre>
<p>or ..</p>
<pre><code>pipx install pyvserv
</code></pre>
<p>pip installs the scripts in ~/.local/bin, so add the following line<br />
  to the end of ~/.bashrc:</p>
<pre><code>PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
</code></pre>
<p>This workaround is not needed if one installs pyvserv in a virtual environment.</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m venv pip_pyvserv
cd pip_pyvserv
source ./bin/avtivate
pip install pyvserv
... continue as needed.
</code></pre>
<p>The makefile target 'make installvirt' will install pyvserv in a virtual<br />
environment.</p>
<p>Running pyvserv as a system daemon from virtual environment needs extra<br />
configuration steps. You may use the make target: 'make genservice_virt'<br />
and activate with 'make instservice'<br />
Please see the relevant systemctl manuals.</p>
<h4>Quick map:</h4>
<pre><code>Server.     subdir: pyvserver       -- Server has most all the commands
Client.     subdir: pyvclient       -- Exercise server commands / demo code
Test Suite. subdir: pyvclient/tests -- official pytest tests
Tool Suite. subdir: pyvtools        -- Key generation ... etc
GUI base    subdir: pyvgui          -- Monitoring / Administering the server
Studies.    subdir: study           -- Testing/learning subsystems (ignore it)
</code></pre>
<h4>Quick start:</h4>
<p>One can mimic global connectivity on a single machine. This would allow the study<br />
of the client / server interaction before live deployment. This chapter assumes<br />
installation / clone from github, replicating directory structure on the<br />
local drive.</p>
<pre><code>open terminal window
navigate to the server's pyvserver subdir
type: ./pyvserv.py

open another terminal window
navigate to the pyvclient subdir
type: ./pyvcli_hello.py
</code></pre>
<p>The following (and more) should be printed on the command line:</p>
<pre><code>./pyvcli_hello.py

Server initial: ['OK', 'pyvserv 1.0.4 ready']
resp ['OK', 'Hello', '4814b46a-9489-4720-af7d-aa14ba19f2be', '11367']
Server quit response: ['OK', 'Bye', '11367']
</code></pre>
<p>Quick rundown of the above test:</p>
<pre><code>1.) Server responds to connection with signin message
2.) Delivers OK status, hello message, server serial number, and a unique id
3.) Server signs off. Repeats unique id / session number.
</code></pre>
<p>This interaction is typical of all the commands.</p>
<p>The unique ID is the session's thread ID and it is not meant to be used other than<br />
identifying the session on the client side.</p>
<p>The best way to learn about the operation of the server is to look at the<br />
sample client examples in the client source tree. (Files named pyvcli_*)</p>
<h2>The pip install</h2>
<p>Scripts are provided for the server, and some test clients. The<br />
server can be started as</p>
<pre><code>pyvserver
</code></pre>
<p>The -P option is for non Developer mode, enabling 2FA authentication.<br />
(two factor authentication)</p>
<p>The command line client can be started as:</p>
<pre><code>pyvcli_cli
</code></pre>
<p>In the command line client most of the server functions can be exercised.<br />
See the pyvcli_* utils for more examples of driving the server. On a<br />
fresh install, one may need to execute the pyvcli_uini.py to create an initial<br />
admin user, with password 1234. The uini command will prompt if this is<br />
what was intended.</p>
<p>The cli utility command 'help' will deliver information on the available commands.</p>
<p>!!! IMPORTANT !!! Make sure you change this when testing / learning is over.</p>

<p>The utilities can also be executed from the 'pyvclient' sub directory by<br />
 post fixing with script extension. (add the .py extension like: ./pyvcli_cli.py)</p>
<p>The date formats for specifying record date filter dates are:</p>
<p>'Y-m-d+H:M' 'Y-m-d' 'm-d' 'm-d+H-M'</p>
<p>Where Y=year m=month d=day H=hour M=minutes, just like in strftime.<br />
The hour is in 24 hour notation.</p>
<p>The following are all valid dates specs, specifying the same date<br />
(in 2024 apr 15 at 00:00):</p>
<pre><code>'2024-04-15' '2024-04-15+0:0' '04-15 04-15+00:00'
</code></pre>
<h2>Testing:</h2>
<p>All pytest cases pass successfully. Note that for the pytest client<br />
tests one needs to start the server. ('./pyvserv.py' or pyvserv if installed)<br />
The server --port and --dataroot option can be used to start the server in<br />
an alternate 'universe', so it does not interfere with production.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Additional tests can be found in the tests/ directory. The pyvcli_* files in the<br />
'pyvclient' directory may also serve as test cases.</p>
<h2>Production:</h2>
<p>Once the testing phase is complete, deploying it for production needs a<br />
complete wipe of the data. There are Makefile targets that do that<br />
(make cleanall). Restarting the server will create the new environment without<br />
any users. To allow operation one may create the initial user with the pyvcli_uini<br />
functions and / or scripts. Make sure you create strong passwords.<br />
The uini command can only operate successfully if there are no users present in the<br />
pyvserv system, and it is executed from the loopback interface. For example,<br />
the command line utility ./pyvcli_uini.py can be used;<br />
For production, uini should executed with the -t option to prompt for a password.</p>
<h2>Screen shots:</h2>
<p>Following, a set of screen shots to demonstrate the sub systems from entering<br />
voter data, casting votes, monitoring vote servers, watching vote tallies.</p>
<h3>Screen shot of the Monitoring tool:</h3>
<p><img alt="Screen Shot" src="montool.png" /></p>
<p>This screen shot depicts the monitoring (control panel) application 'pyvcpanel'.<br />
The top left area contains a live view of the pyvserver syslog. The top right<br />
contains a live view of the replicator log.</p>
<p>The bottom area of the window contains a live view of the incoming data, as it is<br />
originally formatted, without the blockchain and hash details.</p>
<p>All views monitor the live log files, on the default setup. The montor functions<br />
operate, without interfering with any of the operations.</p>
<h3>Screen shot of the Voter Entry tool:</h3>
<p><img alt="Screen Shot" src="people.png" /></p>
<p>The UUID fields serve identification of the voter, the organization hosting<br />
the record entry, and the operator that entered this record.</p>
<h3>Screen shot of the Ballot Editing tool:</h3>
<p><img alt="Screen Shot" src="ballot.png" /></p>
<p>The UUID fields serve identification of the ballot, the organization hosting<br />
the ballot entry, and the operator that entered this record.</p>
<h3>Screen shot of the Vote Casting tool:</h3>
<p><img alt="Screen Shot" src="cast.png" /></p>
<p>The vote choices are presented in random order, as recent studies show the<br />
order influences the voting process.<br />
The UUID fields serve identification of the vote, the organization hosting<br />
the ballot entry, and the operator that entered this record.</p>
<p><img alt="Screen Shot" src="qrscreen.png" /></p>
<p>Every relevant UUID is viewable as a QR code. The QR code than can be<br />
used to search / retrieve an entry. The pyvserv clients are equipped with<br />
scanning functionality, navigating to the correct record when presenting the<br />
QR code to the camera. For instance, a picture of the QR code on the cell phone<br />
allows one to locate the record immediately.</p>
<h2>Windows compatibility</h2>
<p>Pyvserv now functions in the Windows MSYS2 subsystem. All the major<br />
functionalities are ported. The file locking mechanism works, and all the<br />
pytests pass. Naturally, logging and readline etc ... works with the usual<br />
windows caveat.</p>
<p>For the GUI functions ona my need to install the PyGobject subsystem.<br />
Instructions can be found very easily for that.</p>
<p>Below, a screenshot of the pyvserv control panel in MSYS2.</p>
<p><img alt="Screen Shot" src="winscreen.png" /></p>
<p>The project is functional in MSYS2, but for real deployment we recommend Linux.</p>

<h2>Security review:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;  As of today, (Fri 15.Mar.2024) the 256 bit AES is considered unbreakable by<br />
available state of the art means. The key exchange algorithm ECC 384 bit is<br />
also considered safe. These algorithms are used dynamically, as a randomly picked<br />
key is used in every session. The session is also able to dynamically change keys<br />
mid flight, on command.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The checksum verification and link verification both use SHA256 (256 bit)<br />
hashes. This is generated every time a transaction is created.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The proof of work is a modest 3 generations deep. This can be calculated<br />
with an everyday desktop in one ... to ... three seconds. Even though this looks like<br />
a small amount, it adds up if one wants to re-generate (fake) a whole chain.<br />
Additionally, the check sum, the link sum, and proof of work interact, changing one<br />
will effect the other. This way a sum verification and link verification and the<br />
proof of work verification together create an ironclad safety solution.</p>
