<h1>PyvServer</h1>

<h2>Fully encrypted TCP/IP server.</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; PyvServ is an encrypting TCP/IP server written in Python. The
encryption algorithm is AES. (Advanced Encryption Standard) The key exchange
uses ECC. (Elliptic curve) The server can be fully administered from the
protocol side.</p>

<h2>How to use, what it is for:</h2>

<pre><code>Public Voting System Blockchain server.
Charity administration, trust maintenance. (Zakat)
Internal currency / resource maintenance.
</code></pre>

<h4>Public Voting System Blockchain server.</h4>

<p>The system maintains an encrypted chain of vote events. Every entry has
(among others) the Voter ID, an Electronic ID, and the vote action (register / cast /
un-cast / withdraw), and of course, the vote.</p>

<p>The voter ID is a number allocated by authorities, the Electronic ID is a
number allocated on initial login / registration / transaction by the system.
The Voter Block Chain, the associated IDs, and the vote is visible to the public,
so every voter can verify his / her participation. The voter ID is visible, but
the data behind it is known by the electorate only.</p>

<p>The blockchain may be replicated to independent hosts, so falsifying it
would require breaching multiple services.</p>

<p>The blockchain visibility allows that every voter can verify their participation.
This also allows all parties to verify the chain, and create independent counts.</p>

<p>The chain can  be verified for legitimate and singular registration. This system
crates accountability from both the voter's side and the electorate (authority's) side.</p>

<h4>Charity administration, trust maintenance. (Zakat)</h4>

<p>The blockchain will allow the donation's public visibility and the donation's
usage. It can accommodate arbitrary information, for instance: disbursement
target, fund source, funding entity ... etc. The system handles unique IDs
transparently, which allows privileged information to be encoded as a unique ID.
This unique ID than can be turned back to real information by the publisher
of the Unique ID, preserving privacy.</p>

<h4>Internal resource / currency maintenance</h4>

<p>The blockchain will allow monitoring internal resource allocation / usage.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; PyvServ contains protocol level encryption, which can be switched on by
instructing the server to use an encryption (session) key.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; PyvServ contains a key exchange protocol, so the new session keys
can be transmitted securely. The key exchange is based on ECC.</p>

<p>PyvServ has utilities to generate encryption keys. At least one
key needs to be generated before use. (now automatic) The server picks from
a pool of keys, so communication data is always distinctive. Make sure you
generate some new keys with the 'pyvgenkeys' utility before production
deployment.</p>

<p>PyvServ has blockchain empowered back end. The new data is linked to the
previous record. Utilities to verify the data are also provided.
(dbaseadm and chainadm)</p>

<p>PyvServ has file upload / download capabilities with encrypted transport.</p>

<p>PyvServ has replication facilities via a client based 'I have You have'
 mechanism featuring encrypted transport. It is also capable of replication
 on a 'replicate when received' mechanism. The replicated records are marked
 with a replication count, so replication does not enter looping. By default,
 the replicated records are not replicated any further, assuming a flat
 structure of replication.</p>

<h4>Installation:</h4>

<pre><code>pip install pyvserv
</code></pre>

<p>Dependencies:</p>

<p>Most linux systems already have all the dependencies by default. Some dependencies
 are added automatically on installation.</p>

<pre><code> pydbase, pyvpacker, pyvecc, pyvguicom
</code></pre>

<p>The firewall needs to be opened for incoming connections on port xxxx</p>

<p>For example (assuming port 6666):</p>

<pre><code>sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6666
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --sport 6666
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that this is not a recommendation, it is a port we used during
 development.</p>

<h4>Start server</h4>

<p>The python server can be added to the system servers with the Makefile targets
'make genservice' and 'make instservice'
 The scripts will generate the service file to run under current user's
 credentials, and install it onto the running system. (requires sudo)</p>

<h4>Platform:</h4>

<pre><code>This project was developed on Ubuntu 22.x. Most linux distributions should work.
</code></pre>

<h4>Working parts:</h4>

<pre><code>Server.     subdir: pyvserver       -- Server has most of the commands done
Client.     subdir: pyvclient       -- Exercise server commands / demo code
Tool Suite. subdir: pyvtools        -- Key generation etc ...
Test Suite. subdir: pyvclient/tests -- official pytest tests
GUI base    subdir: pyvgui          -- Monitoring / administering the server
Studies.    subdir: study           -- testing/learning subsystems (ignore it)
</code></pre>

<h4>Quick start:</h4>

<p>One can mimic global connectivity on a single machine. This would allow the study
of the client / server interaction before live deployment. This chapter assumes
installation from github, replicating directory structure on the local drive.</p>

<pre><code>open terminal window
navigate to the server's pyvserver subdir
type ./pyvserv.py

open another terminal window
navigate to the pyvclient subdir
type ./pyvcli_hello.py
</code></pre>

<p>The following (and more) should be printed on the command line:</p>

<pre><code>./pyvcli_hello.py
Server initial: ['OK', 'pyvserv 1.0 ready']
resp ['OK', 'Hello', '6ccdaaf1-a22d-4140-9608-8fb93a8845af', '11812']
Server quit response: ['OK', 'Bye', '11812']
</code></pre>

<p>Quick rundown of the above test:</p>

<p>1.) Server responds to connection
2.) Delivers OK status, hello message, server serial number, and a unique id
3.) Server signs off. This interaction is typical of all the commands.</p>

<p>The unique ID is the session's thread ID and it is not cryptographically secure;</p>

<p>The best way to learn about the operation of the server is to look at the
sample client examples in the client source tree. (Files named pyvcli_*)</p>

<h2>The pip install</h2>

<p>Scripts are provided for the server, and some test clients. The
  server can be started as</p>

<pre><code>pyvserver -D
</code></pre>

<p>The -D option is for Developer mode, disabling 2FA authentication.</p>

<p>The command line client can be started as:</p>

<pre><code>pyvcli_cli
</code></pre>

<p>The command line client starts, and the server functions can be excersized
from it. See the pycli_* utils for examples of driving the server.</p>

<h2>Command line help</h2>

<pre><code>Usage: pyvserv.py [options]

        -h   --help                 -  Show Help
</code></pre>

<h2>Testing:</h2>

<p>All pytest cases pass. Note that the for the pytest client tests one needs to
 start the 'pyvserv.py' server.
 The server --port and --dataroot option can ba used to start the server in an alternate
 universe. Please make sure it does not interfere with production.</p>

<p>Additional tests can be found in the test directory. The pyvcli_* files may also
serve as test cases.</p>

<p>More test coming soon ....</p>

<h2>Screen shots:</h2>

<p>Screen shot of the Monitoring tool:</p>

<p><img src="montool.png" alt="Screen Shot" title="" /></p>

<p>This screen shot depicts the monitoring (control panel) application 'pyvcpanel'.
The top left area contains a live view of the pyvserver syslog. The top right
contains a live view of the replicator log.</p>

<p>The bottom area of the window contains a live view of the incoming data, as it is
originally formatted, without the blockchain and hash details.</p>

<p>All views monitor the live files, on the default setup, without interfering
with any of the operations.</p>

<h2>Windows compatibility</h2>

<p>Pyvserv now functions in the Windows MSYS2 subsystem. All the major
functionalities are ported. The file locking mechanism works, and all the
pytests pass. Naturally, logging and readline etc ... works with the usual
windows caveat.</p>

<p>For the GUI functions install the PyGobject subsystem. Instructions can
be found very easily for that. Below, a screenshot of the pyvserv control panel
in MSYS2.</p>

<p><img src="winscreen.png" alt="Screen Shot" title="" /></p>

<p>The project is functional in MSYS2, but for real deployment we recommend Linux.</p>

<h2>Security review:</h2>

<p>&nbsp;  As of today, (Fri 15.Mar.2024) the 256 bit AES is considered unbreakable by
available state of the art means. The key exchange algorithm ECC 384 bit is
also considered safe. These algorithms are used dynamically, as a randomly picked
key is used in every session. The session is also able to dynamically change keys
mid flight, on command.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The checksum verification and link verification both use SHA256 (256 bit)
hashes. This is generated every time a transaction is created.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The proof of work is a modest 3 generations deep. This can be calculated
with an everyday desktop in one - to - three seconds. Even though this looks like
a small amount, it adds up if one wants to re-generate (fake) a whole chain.
Additionally, the check sum, the link sum, and proof of work interact, changing one
will effect the other. This way a sum verification and link verification and the
proof of work verification together create an ironclad safety solution.</p>
