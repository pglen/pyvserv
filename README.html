<h1>PyvServer</h1>

<h2>Python fully encrypted TCP/IP server</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; PyvServ is a fully fledged encrypting TCP/IP server written in Python. The
encryption algorithm is AES. The server can be fully administered from
the protocol side.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; PyvServ contains protocol level encryption, which can be switched on by
instructing the server to use an encryption (session) key.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; PyvServ contains a key exchange protocol, so the new session keys
can be transmitted securely. The key exchange is based on ECC.</p>

<p>PyvServ has utilities to generate encryption keys. At least one
key needs to be generated before use. (now automatic) The server picks from
a pool of keys, so communication data is always distinctive. Make sure you
generate them with the 'pyvgenkeys' utility.</p>

<p>PyvServ has blockchain empowered back end. The new data is linked to the
previous record. Utilities to verify the data are also provided.
(dbaseadm and chainadm)</p>

<p>PyvServ has file upload / download capabilities with encrypted transport.</p>

<p>PyvServ has replication facilities via a client based 'I have You have'
 mechanism featuring encrypted transport. It is also capable of replication
 on a replicate when received mechanism. The replicated records are marked,
 so replication does not enter looping.</p>

<p>Project is still in motion, but a lot of it is usable.</p>

<h4>Installation:</h4>

<pre><code>pip install pyvserv
</code></pre>

<p>Dependencies:</p>

<p>Most linux system have all the dependencies by default. Some dependencies
 are added automatically on installation.</p>

<pre><code> pydbase, pyvpacker, pyvecc
</code></pre>

<p>The firewall needs to be opened for incoming connections on port xxxx</p>

<p>For example (assuming port 6666):</p>

<pre><code>sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6666
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --sport 6666
</code></pre>

<h4>Working parts:</h4>

<pre><code>Server.     subdir: pyvserver       -- Server has 90% of the commands done
Client.     subdir: pyvclient       -- 90% the commands
Tool Suite. subdir: pyvtools        -- Key generation etc ...
Test Suite. subdir: pyvclient/tests -- Test pass
Studies.    subdir: study           -- testing/learning subsystems (ignore it)
</code></pre>

<h4>Quick start:</h4>

<p>One can mimic global connectivity on a single machine. This would allow the study
of the client / server interaction before live deployment. This
chapter assumes installation from github, replicating directory
structure on the local drive.</p>

<pre><code>open terminal window
navigate to the server's pyvserver subdir
type ./pyvserv.py  -D

The -D option stands for development mode. The server will not ask for
2FA authentication.

open another terminal window
navigate to the pyvclient subdir
type ./pycli_hello.py
</code></pre>

<p>The following (and more) should be printed on command line:</p>

<pre><code>./pycli_hello.py
Server initial: ['OK', 'pyvserv 1.0 ready']
resp ['OK', 'Hello', '6ccdaaf1-a22d-4140-9608-8fb93a8845af', '11812']
Server quit response: ['OK', 'Bye', '11812']
</code></pre>

<p>Quick rundown of the above test:</p>

<p>1.) Server responds to connection
2.) Delivers OK status, hello message, server serial number, and a unique id
3.) Server signs off. This interaction is typical of all the commands.</p>

<p>The unique ID the thread ID and it is not cryptographically secure;</p>

<p>The best way to learn about the operation of the server is to look at the
sample client examples in the client source tree. (Files named pycli_*)</p>

<h2>Testing:</h2>

<p>All pytest cases pass. Note that the for the pytest client tests one needs to
 start the 'pyvserv.py' server.
 The server --port and --dataroot option can ba used to start the server in an alternate
 universe.  Please make sure it does not interfere with production.</p>

<p>More test coming soon ....</p>

<p>This screenshot depicts the monitoring (control panel) application 'pyvcpanel'.
The top left area contains a live view of the pycserver syslog. The top right
contains a live view of the replicator log.</p>

<p>The buttom area of the window contains a live view of the incoming data, as it is
originally formatted, without the blockchain and hash details.</p>

<p>All views monitor the live files, without intefering with any of the operations.</p>
