Python Cryptography Toolkit (pycrypto)
======================================

This is a collection of both secure hash functions (such as SHA256 and
RIPEMD160), and various encryption algorithms (AES, DES, RSA, ElGamal,
etc.).  The package is structured to make adding new modules easy.
This section is essentially complete, and the software interface will
almost certainly not change in an incompatible way in the future; all
that remains to be done is to fix any bugs that show up.  If you
encounter a bug, please report it in the Launchpad bug tracker at
